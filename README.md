# final_Project

Create a Blackjack program in 3 parts

part 1 - Blackjack classes - use a shoe of 6 decks of cards, and shuffle the shoe if the card count gets < 100 reshuffle

part 2 - Blackjack game using classes and user input - assume every hand is worth $1, tracking win/loss amount

part 3 - Build a results table to show what strategy loses the least money - for each starting hand value, either hit or stand and track the result 
- just do a single hit or stand and then track win/lose/draw, simulate 100,000 hands, track our starting hand value and then randomly pick hit or
  stand, and track win/loss/draw result
at the end, display a table showing the results of hitting and standing for each starting value
